# Lunchabler Web App

A MERN web app that helps groups agree on where to grab some food. Specify who is going out to eat, and Lunchabler will provide the optimal restaurant choices based on user-provided restaurant preferences. 

## Running the server
(Assumes a Cloud9 development environment.)

1) Start MongoDB. If MongoDB is not yet installed on the C9 workspace, follow instructions here: https://community.c9.io/t/setting-up-mongodb/1717

2) Seed the database

    $ npm run seed
    
3) Start the development server

    $ npm run dev

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9users.io/'.
